# Code repository (sub-directory) for ground/non-ground classification and height normalization operation

Things to note:
1. The `groundClassif_heightNormalize_PC.R` script in this sub-directory can be used for the ground/non-ground classification of point cloud and height normalization operation. 
2. The `INPUT` for this script is the multispectral point cloud (stored in the `DATA` folder) and the `OUTPUT` is a ground/non-ground classified point cloud with height normaliztion operation  (in the `EXPORTS` folder). 
3. Before running script, make sure to change variables in the `CHANGE VARIABLES HERE` section and any section that is highlighted with `~~~~~~~~~~` or `===========` or `--------------`
