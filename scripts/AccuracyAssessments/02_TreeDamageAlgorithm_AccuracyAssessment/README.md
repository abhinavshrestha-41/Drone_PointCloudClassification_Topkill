# Code repository (sub-directory) for the accuracy assessment of tree damage algorithm 

Things to note:
1. The `resample_ConfusionMatrix_forDamageAlgorithm.R` script computes the averaged confusion matrices with bootstrapping (sampling with replacement) for the tree damage algorithm accuracy assessments.
2. Before running script, make sure to change variables in the `CHANGE VARIABLES HERE` section and any section that is highlighted with `~~~~~~~~~~` or `===========` or `--------------` or `**********` 
3. The `PythonScripts_forArcGIS` sub-directory contains Python code used in ArcGIS for the accuracy assessments.
