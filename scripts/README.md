# Scripts

1. The numbered directories (e.g. `01_...`, `02_...`) follow the methodology outlined in the MS thesis/manuscript for this project. Each folder is a major step in the methodology.  

2. Each numbered directory contains:
* `README` document with content title (top of document) set as the name of the step in the project methodology  
* `DATA` sub-directory that contains the `INPUT`data
* `EXPORTS` sub-directory that contains the `OUTPUT` data
* The remaining files in the sub-directories are scripts run for the methodology stage of the directory.

## Project methodology workflow:
