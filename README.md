# Tree segmentation and point cloud classification for tree damage assessment and top-kill assessment: Code repository

> Project title: **Evaluating a novel approach to detect the vertical structure of insect damage in trees using a combination of multispectral and three-dimensional data from drone imagery in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA**

### Repository information:
* This GitHub repository contains necessary code and materials for combination of tree segmentation and point cloud classification for subsequent tree damage assessment and top-kill detection.
* The metholody uses functions from the [`lidR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) R package.  
* The code available in the repository is to be applied to a subset data of the study site (also included in the repository). 
* Please refer to the manuscript for details about the project **[URL FOR MANUSCRIPT]**  

#### The repository contains the following directories:
* The [`scripts`](scripts) directory contains R and python scripts in numbered sub-directories that outline the methodology of this project.
* The [`docs`](docs) directory contains housekeeping documents and figures used for the construction and maintainance of this repository.
