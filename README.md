### Repository information:
* This GitHub repository contains necessary code and materials for combination of tree segmentation and point cloud classification for subsequent tree damage assessment and top-kill detection.
* The metholody uses functions from the [`lidR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) R package.  
* The code available in the repository is to be applied to a subset data of the study site (also included in the repository). 
* Please refer to the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/8/1365" target="_blank">manuscript</a> for details about the project.
