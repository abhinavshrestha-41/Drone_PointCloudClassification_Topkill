# Tree segmentation and point cloud classification for tree damage assessment and top-kill detection: Code repository

Project title: **Evaluating a novel approach to detect the vertical structure of insect damage in trees using a combination of multispectral and three-dimensional data from drone imagery in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA**
<br>

### Repository information:
* This GitHub repository contains necessary code and materials for combination of tree segmentation and point cloud classification for subsequent tree damage assessment and top-kill detection.
* The metholody uses functions from the [`lidR`](https://github.com/r-lidar/lidR) R package.
